      <title>RAG Chatbot: Vector Database Approach</title>

      <description>In a previous blog, I wrote about a RAG chatbot that I created using a dataset of medical questions and answers.
The RAG chatbot embedded the userâ€™s question and retrieved the most relevant answers from an embedding file. Then, using the retrieved answers, GPT-4o-mini generated the final answer.
In this blog, we will get rid of the embedding file and use a vector database instead, the code will be repurposed to be smaller in size in order to deploy the chatbot using Docker and AWS.</description>

      <description>A few years ago, when I started delving deeper into programming, AI was one of the main topics that captivated my interest.
It was only natural for me to stumble upon this subject since I was drawn to scientific programming and Python. Back in the day, AI wasn&amp;rsquo;t the hype as it is today. Most importantly, when it was discussed, it was associated with different domains, not just LLMs as it is today.</description>
