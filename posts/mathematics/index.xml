      <description>Randomness is an interesting concept, we have seen in previous blogs how it can be harnessed to compute mathematical constants, and even create a universal computer. In this blog we will see how randomness can be used to model diffusion. Diffusion can be defined as the movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. This is a common phenomenon and can be observed in our daily lives.</description>

      <description>Matrix calculator for two by two and three by three real matrices This is a project that I did around three years ago, just after I finished taking my very first comprehensive programming course, it was about the C++ language.&#xA;Back then I knew that there are many better options to do matrix calculation, mostly using the Python Numpy library. I also knew that there are many C++ libraries that provide matrix calculation, most notably Eigen.</description>
