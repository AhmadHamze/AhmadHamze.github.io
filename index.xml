      <description>Introduction This is a project that uses websockets to create a drawing on a page and copy this drawing to another page instantly.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of websockets before, here&amp;rsquo;s the main idea:
  You send data from your browser to a server using a &amp;ldquo;socket&amp;rdquo; which is a real-time connection that can send data back and forth.
  There is another computer that is connected to the server and will receive the data from it also using a socket.</description>

      <description>Matrix calculator for two by two and three by three real matrices This is a project that I did around three years ago, just after I finished taking my very first comprehensive programming course, it was about the C++ language.
Back then I knew that there are many better options to do matrix calculation, mostly using the Python Numpy library. I also knew that there are many C++ libraries that provide matrix calculation, most notably Eigen.</description>

      <title>Lessons Learned From My First Web Dev Job</title>

      <description>Recently I started a web development job as a front-end developer, here are a few things I learned so far.
1. Make sure to have the correct working environment As you might know, preparing the development environment is an essential step when you start a new project. In my case, the team decided to use Nix for package management (it&amp;rsquo;s awesome). The first problem I faced is that I am using Windows, and to be able to use nix on Windows you have to use WSL.</description>

      <description>Advice to my past self regarding programming In this blog, I talk about a few things that I wish somebody told me back when I started learning to program by myself, I hope you can benefit from this if you&amp;rsquo;re also new to programming.
1. Talk to real programmers who know what they&amp;rsquo;re doing Getting into the world of programming is quite easy, all you have to do is own a laptop, watch YouTube videos and try to build programs yourself.</description>

      <description>Using the Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate the value of &amp;#x03C0;First of all, let&#39;s talk briefly about what is a Monte-Carlo simulation.
Simply put, it is a computational method that uses a large number of random samples to obtain a result. It is used in awide range of disciplines like mathematics, computer graphics, and physical sciences.In this blog, we will see how we can use this method to estimate the value of the mathematical constant \( \pi \).</description>
